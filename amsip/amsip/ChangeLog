25/04/2012 - 4.7.0 -cont-
	* if audio bitrate is set to 30, sdp answer will keep
	  only one of the lowest bitrate codec from the offer.
	  This is to be used with 3G network to force usage of
	  low bitrate codec when the offer contains high bitrate
	  codecs as prefered codecs.
	* improve usage of ICE if one side has no ICE support.
	* update to latest ZRTP
	  (not compiled by default // ask support)

	  ICE enabled and a delay occur in stream
	  establishment.

	  several audio conference with several sound cards.
