/** 
 * @defgroup libamsip The antisip SIP softphone library
 * @brief libamsip Version @AMSIP_VERSION@
 *
 * @see http://www.antisip.com
 *
 * @section what_is_it What is amsip
 *
 * libamsip implements the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP -rfc3261-)
 *
 * libamsip is owned by ANTISIP SARL (COPYING). PLEASE CONTACT
 * <aymeric@osip.org> FOR COMMERCIAL LICENSE.
 * 
 * @section what_is_relation_with_osip What is the relation between osip, eXosip2 and amsip 
 * 
 * The GNU osip stack is the first step needed to implement SIP
 * applications. As a low layer stack, there is no limitation in
 * the way to use it, but the very large API makes it rather complex
 * and not suitable for beginners.
 *
 * The eXtended eXosip library is based on osip and implements a lot
 * more SIP stuff so you can quickly build compliant SIP applications.
 * The API is enough flexible to allow you to control and complete SIP
 * messages. Thus, it keeps the stack extensible.
 *
 * While osip can be used for any SIP applications, eXosip2 only
 * provide APIs to control endpoints.
 * 
 * amsip is a COMMERCIAL LIBRARY which provide a complete and simple
 * API for softphone. It adds to osip/eXosip RTP support, codec support
 * (speex/ilbc/g711a/g711u/...), and audio support on linux and windows.
 *
 * @section what_is_sip What is SIP
 *
 * SIP is an IP telephony protocol made by the IETF.
 * It is an effort to create a simple (telephony is never
 * simple) and powerfull protocol for next generation
 * telephony systems.
 *
 * @section what_features SIP features
 *
 * SIP is not just about telephony. It's much more
 * that what you expect from phones. SIP means mobility,
 * video, textual call informations, file exchange,
 * instant messaging, presence support and much more!
 *
 * @section what_freesoftware eXosip2 is free software
 *
 * As eXosip2 is GPL, you MUST choose to release your
 * SIP applications based on eXosip2 under the GPL license.
 *
 * For any use of eXosip2 beyond the rights granted to you by the
 * GPL license, please contact my company at <aymeric@osip.org>.
 * 
 * With oSIP (which is LGPL), you still have the choice to implement
 * propriatory application and link with oSIP. For the
 * benefit of the community (and for your own benefit),
 * please consider implementing your application in GPL.
 *
 * Still with osip, you have to respect the license terms.
 * Mainly, users of your software must be able to fix bugs
 * in osip themselves. (they must have the source code,
 * be able to compile it and link your product with the new
 * version.)
 *
 * @section what_thanks Thanks
 *
 * Thanks to all the contributors and to all bug reporters.
 * Enjoy osip!
